### Hello there 👋

My name is Tomas Ravinskas and I'm an Open-Source/freelance developer based in Kaunas, Lithuania 🇱🇹 Northern Europe 🥶
While it's cold here, I have two cats to keep me company, Bianca and Nora.

Throughout my years as coder (8 and counting 😅) I've experimented with many programming and scripting languages,
but only Python and Typescript earned a special place in my heart ❤️

I dabble in C/C++ when I need lower level system access or improved performance, but I'm not quite confident in my skills there yet.

I also learned Java, in vocational school even. I find Java so repulsive that without a teacher I couldn'd bare to study it. 😆

I started as a desktop app developer, for I wanted to write apps I'd enjoy using myself. These days however, my focus is mostly on
mobile, for similar reasons tho.

I've also developed several libraries because I figured the code I use in my apps could benefit the community too.

Currently my interest lies with distributed systems, P2P, and Hyperswarm.
I successfully ported Hyperswarm to React-Native and I'm itching to make some cool cross platform apps with it, so stay tuned!

I'm also interested in Voice Recognition, NLP and related technologies, especially as they relate to Lithuanian language.
