_Hello, there!_

I'm Tomas Ravinskas, fullstack/mobile developer at @holepunchto, [bringing 🍐2🍐 communications](https://keet.io/) to world. This, however, is my personal account and repositories here bear no relation to Holepunch Inc. I'm based in Kaunas, Lithuania, Northern Europe.

I've been coding for a little over 10 years now, and in that time I picked up various skills and interests. My primary interest these days is in 🍐2🍐, which brought me to 🕳️🥊. I'm also very interested in cross-platform development and code sharing.

I'm fluent in Javascript/Typescript and Python, I'm also competent with C, C++, Kotlin, and Swift. I dabble in Rust. I can write code in Java and Objective-C, but it's not gonna be very good code and I'll hate every minute of it.
